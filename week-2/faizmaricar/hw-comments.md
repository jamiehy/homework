### Homework Comments
- I like how you thought about reusing the class for `.logo`. That's absolutely how you want to use CSS classes, set a default style and overwrite it to repurpose the style.

- You might want to use an `<a>` tags for the links to **Get It Now**. Also you might not want to use a percentage width, as you probably don't want the link's width to change when the browser resizes.

- In some areas where you have a `div` inside a `section`, you can actually combine the CSS styles and apply it to the `section`.

Nice work!
