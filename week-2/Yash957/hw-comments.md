### Homework Comments
- It was interesting that you constrained the entire website with a width of 50%. It definitely looks like the screenshot provided, however you would want your website to take up the whole browser width.

- There are 2 ways in which you can center elements on your website, either with `margin: 0 auto;` or with `text-align: center;`

- Since the button is essentially a link, you can use the `<a>` tag for **Get It Now** and **Sign Up Now**. Also, check out this example to see how to achieve the link without the use of `width` and `height` property: http://codepen.io/calvintan/pen/GqLrbq
