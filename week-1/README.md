# Week 1 Homework Assignment

For the first assignment, you will begin creating the beginnings of your first website. Take what you've learned from class and build a portfolio site that showcases all of the projects you'll be completing over the next few weeks. 

Build two pages 

- an 'About' page, and
- a 'Portfolio' page
 
that link to one another. Your 'About' should describe your mission and value proposition and your 'Portfolio' should include screenshots with descriptions of the work you [will] do for Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and CitiPix.

Don't worry if you can't come up with any text for the pages – we've provided you with some sample copy that you can use (look at `sample-contents.txt`).

There are also some images you can use on the portfolio page inside the `images` directory.
